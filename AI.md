Co-Pilot and ChatGPT used to help modify and generate Javadoc comments. While both were inaccurate
Co-Pilot was generally more helpful in generating comments for methods that were not yet implemented. I still
needed to review the code generated and modified by AI.
Co-Pilot was also helpful in writing redundant code, such as getters and setters
ChatGPT was helpful in understanding how to use certain methods as well as providing valualbe insight on how to 
handle certain issues such how to print to the GUI when the file is not found.
